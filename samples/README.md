## Notes

1. The samples using rollbackDataSet method have a limitation for the VSAM datasets. 
 Independently the source dataset volume, as a result, target dataset always has NOVOL 
 (temporary) storage class. If you roll back BackupDataset to OriginalDataset, OriginalDataset 
 becomes a temporary dataset to be deleted. This limitation is in our backlog and will be resolved soon.
 
2. Copy feature generates a temporary data set when it runs.
We recommend you to delete the temporary data set by opening the terminal and issuing the following command:

        npx zowe zos-files delete data-set 'HLQ.TEST4Z.BATCHAPP.DATA(CUSTINC)' -f
