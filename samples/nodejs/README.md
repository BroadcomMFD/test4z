    It checks the 7 main permissions that enable you to run the Test4z Samples
    
    | Permission | Description |
    | --- | --- |  
    **dsCreate**         | Checks whether the user ID has sufficient rights to create data sets
    **commandExec**      | Checks whether the user ID has sufficient rights to execute TSO commands through TSOCMD
