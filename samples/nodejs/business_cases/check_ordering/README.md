## Description of the Application Under Test

**Check Reordering System**

The check reordering system in a bank ensures that clients always have enough checks in their checkbooks. The check reordering system looks for customers low on checks based on the clientâ€™s checkbook size and threshold of remaining checks. The system then issues a notification to the client and orders a new checkbook.


## Use Cases

A batch application has been created and is submitted using Zowe. The batch application performs the following steps:

1. Filter out records from the main dataset based on the **TOTAL_CHECKS**, **ACTUAL_CHECKS**, and **PRODUCT_TYPE** parameters. The records are filtered according to the following criteria:
          
       (ACTUAL-CHECKS <= 3 AND TOTAL-CHECKS = 30 AND (PRODUCT-TYPE='S' OR PRODUCT-TYPE='C)) OR
       (ACTUAL-CHECKS <= 5 AND TOTAL-CHECKS = 50 AND (PRODUCT-TYPE='S' OR PRODUCT-TYPE='C)) OR
       (ACTUAL-CHECKS <= 8 AND TOTAL-CHECKS = 80 AND (PRODUCT-TYPE='S' OR PRODUCT-TYPE='C))
      
2. Modify the filtered records by setting the notification date to the current (today) date.
The modified records are then used by the sample test case.


## Test Suite Steps

*This test folder contains an example use case of the **update** endpoint.*

Test4z will perform the following sequence:

1. ***Create a backup*** of the main data set. 
2. ***Submit a job***  ***through ZOWE***  to make changes in the main data set. This job ***filters out*** some records based on the values of ***TOTAL-CHECKS, ACTUAL-CHECKS*** and ***PRODUCT-TYPE***. The ***Notification date*** for these records is then ***changed*** to today. 
3. ***Verify*** that the ***notification dates*** were successfully ***changed*** and this change happened only on the desired records. In this case the amount of changed records is 24. 
4. ***Revert back the changes*** by copying the backup data set to the main data set. 
5. ***Update a record*** in the main data set, which did not fit in the selection before. This record should now be picked up by the batchapp as well. 
6. ***Submit*** one more time the ***job***  ***through ZOWE***.
7. ***Check*** the amount of ***updated records***. This should now be 25. 
8. ***Revert back the changes*** by copying the backup data set to the main data set.
